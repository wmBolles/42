## 🎯 Repository Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my entire 42 School experience, structured into two main phases:

### 🌊 **Phase 1: The Piscine** 
The selection bootcamp that started it all - an intensive month of C programming fundamentals.

### 🏫 **Phase 2: The Cursus**
The main curriculum featuring advanced projects in systems programming, algorithms, and software engineering.
